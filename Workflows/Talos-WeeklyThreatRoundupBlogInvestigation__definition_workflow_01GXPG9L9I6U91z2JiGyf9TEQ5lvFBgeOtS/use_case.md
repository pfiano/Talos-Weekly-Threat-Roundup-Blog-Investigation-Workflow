Use Case Title: Talos Weekly Roundup Blog Automated Investigation


Problem Statement

Security teams are often too focused on dealing with daily inci¬dent response fires to dedicate time to proactive and scheduled threat hunting operations 
to catch emerging threats in their environments. Even when they have enough time to execute threat hunting exercises, correlating intelligence from multiple 
threat feeds unfortunately is a manual, repetitive exercise that does not leave enough time for decision-making.


Solution

As we all know, Every Friday evening, US time, Talos is publishing a glimpse into the most prevalent threats they have observed over the current week. 

As a SOC analyst following religiously those blogs, you would first want to understand whether there has been an impact of one of those threats in your environment. 
Questions immediately arise: Have we seen these observables? Are these observables suspicious or malicious? Which endpoints have the malicious files or have connected 
to a domain or URL? What can I do about it right now? 

Can we automate all of this? The answer is yes! 

Traditionally, Security analysts would have a “swivel chair” approach to such investigation, employing a sequence of manual actions and carrying out the manual 
correlation of the information gathered throughout the investigation. Thanks to the Orchestration capabilities provided by SecureX and the TALOS Weekly Roundup 
Blog Investigation workflow, Security teams can now schedule this workflow to execute.



Key Customer Outcomes

Accelerated Incident Response:
By replacing low-level manual tasks with corresponding automations, this workflow can shave off large chunks from incident response times while also improving accuracy 
and Security analyst satisfaction 

Increase Analyst Productivity: 
Since low-level tasks are automated and processes are standardized with this workflow when investigation the most prevalent threats that Talos has reported during the 
current week, analysts can spend their time in more important decision-making and charting future security improvements rather than getting mired in grunt work. 

Leverage Existing Investments: 
By automating repeatable actions and minimizing console-switching, security orchestration enables customer security teams to coordinate among multiple products easily and 
extract more value out of existing security investments. 

Standardize and Scale Processes: 
Through step-wise, replicable workflows, like this one, security orchestration can help standardize incident enrichment and response processes that increases the baseline 
quality of response and is primed for scale. 

Improve Overall Security Posture: 
The sum of all aforementioned benefits is an overall improvement of the customer security posture and a corresponding reduction in security and business risk.
